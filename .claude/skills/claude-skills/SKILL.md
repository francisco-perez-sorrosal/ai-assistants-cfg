# Claude Code Skills Development

Reference documentation for developing effective Claude Code Skills. The context window is a public good - only include information Claude doesn't already possess.

## Core Principles

**Conciseness**: Keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines. Use progressive disclosure - split detailed content into separate files loaded on-demand.

**Appropriate Freedom**: Match specificity to task fragility:

- Text instructions for flexible tasks
- Pseudocode for moderate variation
- Specific scripts for error-prone operations

<!-- **Cross-Model Testing**: Validate skills across Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus for effectiveness. -->

## Skill Structure

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: Third-person capability description with trigger terms
allowed-tools: [Optional tool restrictions]
---

# Overview and navigation (SKILL.md stays minimal)
```

### Storage Locations

- **Personal**: `~/.claude/skills/`
- **Project**: `.claude/skills/` (shared via git)
- **Plugin**: Bundled with installed plugins

### Description Best Practices

Write in third person to avoid system prompt conflicts:

✓ "Analyzing spreadsheets and generating reports from Excel files. Use when working with XLSX files, data analysis, or report generation."

✗ "I can help you analyze spreadsheets..."

Include:

- What the skill does
- Specific trigger terms
- Key use cases

## Information Architecture

**Progressive Disclosure Pattern**:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md (overview, navigation only)
├── REFERENCE.md (detailed info, loaded as needed)
├── EXAMPLES.md (usage examples)
└── scripts/ (executable utilities)
```

**File References**: Keep one level deep from `SKILL.md`. Avoid nested references that cause partial reads.

## Content Guidelines

**Consistent Terminology**: Choose one term per concept. Always "API endpoint," not mixing with "URL" or "path."

**Examples Over Description**: Provide input/output pairs showing desired style and detail level.

**Workflows with Checklists**: For complex tasks, provide copyable checklists Claude can track:

```
Step 1: Analyze form (run analyze_form.py)
Step 2: Create mapping structure
Step 3: Apply transformations
```

**Avoid Time-Sensitive Info**: Use "Old Patterns" sections for deprecated methods rather than time-based conditionals.

## Development Workflow

1. **Create Representative Tests**: Define three test scenarios before extensive documentation

2. **Measure Baseline**: Test performance without skill to identify improvement areas

3. **Iterative Development**: Use one Claude instance to create/refine skill content while testing with another on real tasks

4. **Observe Navigation**: Monitor how Claude uses the skill - unexpected file access indicates structure issues

5. **Refine Based on Behavior**: Adjust based on observed gaps and patterns

## Executable Code Best Practices

**Error Handling**: Handle conditions explicitly rather than failing and requiring intervention.

**Justified Constants**: Document why parameters exist:

```python
# Three retries balances reliability vs speed
# Most failures resolve by second retry
MAX_RETRIES = 3
```

**Deterministic vs Reference**: Clarify intent:

- "Run analyze_form.py" (execute)
- "See analyze_form.py" (read as reference)

**MCP Tool Names**: Use fully qualified format: `ServerName:tool_name`

**Package Dependencies**: List required packages and verify availability.

## Common Patterns

### Read-Only Reference Skills

```yaml
allowed-tools: [Read, Grep, Glob]
```

For documentation and code analysis.

### Script-Based Skills

```yaml
allowed-tools: [Read, Bash, Write]
```

Reference scripts with forward slashes: `scripts/helper.py`

### Template-Based Skills

```yaml
allowed-tools: [Read, Write, Edit]
```

Store templates in `templates/` directory.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Windows-style paths (use forward slashes everywhere)
- Too many options (provide one default with escape hatches)
- Vague descriptions (e.g. "Helps with documents")
- Deeply nested references
- Scripts that punt errors to Claude
- Time-based conditionals

## Troubleshooting

### Skill Not Activating

1. Verify description includes specific trigger terms
2. Check YAML syntax (no tabs, proper `---` delimiters)
3. Confirm file location
4. Test with explicit trigger phrases
5. For syntax or feature questions, use Task tool with `subagent_type='claude-code-guide'`

### YAML Errors

- Use spaces, never tabs
- Quote strings with special characters
- Proper `---` delimiters

### Path Issues

- Use forward slashes
- Verify paths exist
- Use `~` for home directory in personal skills

## Final Checklist

Before deploying a skill:

✓ Third-person description with specific trigger terms
✓ `SKILL.md` under 500 lines
✓ One-level-deep file references
✓ Consistent terminology throughout
✓ Concrete examples provided
✓ Progressive disclosure structure
✓ Clear workflows with steps
✓ Scripts with explicit error handling
✓ All package dependencies listed
✓ Tested across Haiku/Sonnet/Opus
✓ Real-world scenario validation
