# Pragmatic Refactoring

Systematic approach to refactoring that prioritizes modularity, low coupling, high cohesion, and maintainable structure.

## Core Principles

**Pragmatism First**: Every refactoring must have a clear purpose. Never refactor for the sake of refactoring.

**Small, Bold Steps**: Make incremental changes that keep the system working. Each step should be independently committable.

**Behavior Preservation**: Refactoring changes structure, not behavior. Tests should pass before and after.

**Simplicity Over Cleverness**: The simplest solution that solves the problem is the best solution.

## The Four Pillars

### 1. Modularity

Break systems into self-contained units with clear responsibilities. Each module should have a single, well-defined purpose and be understandable in isolation.

```python
# Before: Everything in one module
class UserManager:
    def validate_email(self, email): ...
    def hash_password(self, password): ...
    def send_welcome_email(self, user): ...
    def store_in_database(self, user): ...

# After: Separated by concern
# user_validation.py / password_security.py / email_service.py / user_repository.py
```

### 2. Low Coupling

Minimize dependencies between modules. Depend on abstractions, use dependency injection, avoid circular dependencies.

```python
# Before: Tightly coupled
class OrderProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.db = PostgresDatabase()       # Concrete dependency
        self.emailer = SmtpEmailer()       # Concrete dependency

# After: Loosely coupled via abstractions
class OrderProcessor:
    def __init__(self, db: Database, emailer: Emailer):
        self.db = db
        self.emailer = emailer
```

### 3. High Cohesion

Keep related things together, unrelated things apart. Group by what changes together, not by technical category.

```python
# Before: Low cohesion (catch-all utils.py)
def format_date(date): ...
def validate_email(email): ...
def calculate_discount(price, percent): ...

# After: High cohesion (grouped by domain concept)
# date_formatting.py / email_validation.py / pricing.py
```

### 4. Pragmatic Structure

Organize code to match domain concepts, not technical layers.

```text
# Before: Layer-based (technical grouping)
project/
├── models/
├── controllers/
└── services/

# After: Feature-based (domain grouping)
project/
├── users/
├── orders/
└── catalog/
```

## Refactoring Workflow

### 1. Understand Current State

- Read and understand the code
- Identify what's working, what's painful
- Run existing tests (or write characterization tests)

### 2. Plan the Change

- Define clear goal: "Extract payment processing from order service"
- Break into small steps, each safe and testable

### 3. Execute Incrementally

1. **Green Bar**: Ensure all tests pass
2. **Small Change**: One small refactoring
3. **Run Tests**: Verify behavior unchanged
4. **Review**: Check coupling/cohesion improved
5. **Commit**: Save working state
6. **Repeat**: Next small step

If tests fail after a change, revert and try a smaller step.

### 4. Verify and Clean Up

- All tests pass
- No dead code left behind
- Imports are clean
- Run a final check: does each module have a single clear purpose?

## Decision Framework

### Should I Create a New Module?

**Yes, if**: Clear boundary and single responsibility, used by multiple modules, natural cohesion, reduces coupling.

**No, if**: Only one use case, creates artificial separation, increases complexity without benefit.

### Should I Add an Abstraction?

**Yes, if**: Multiple implementations exist or will soon, need to swap implementations, reducing coupling.

**No, if**: Only one implementation exists and likely will, abstraction doesn't hide complexity, YAGNI.

### Should I Split This Package?

**Yes, if**: Multiple unrelated responsibilities, different parts change for different reasons, too large to grasp.

**No, if**: Everything changes together, high cohesion across all parts, splitting would increase coupling.

## Patterns & Scenarios Reference

See [references/patterns.md](references/patterns.md) for detailed refactoring patterns and common scenarios with full code examples:

**Patterns**: Extract Module, Introduce Abstraction, Eliminate Circular Dependencies, Extract Data Structure, Inline Over-Abstraction

**Scenarios**: God Object/Module, Feature Envy, Primitive Obsession, Utils Hell, Deep Nesting

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| **Over-Abstraction** — interfaces without multiple implementations | Start concrete, extract when second use case appears |
| **Anemic Models** — data classes with no behavior | Move behavior into the class |
| **Shotgun Surgery** — one change touches many files | Group things that change together |
| **Speculative Generality** — flexibility for hypothetical needs | Implement for current requirements only |
| **Premature Optimization** — optimizing without measurements | Profile first, optimize hot paths only |

## When to Refactor

**Don't refactor if**:

- No tests exist and behavior is unclear (write tests first)
- Code is about to be deleted
- Working code with no current pain point

**Do refactor when**:

- Adding feature and current structure is an obstacle
- Bug reveals structural problem
- Code duplication reaches three instances
- Coupling prevents testing

## Code Metrics

Monitor these thresholds:

- **Module size**: >500 lines needs review
- **Cyclomatic complexity**: Functions >10 need simplification
- **Coupling**: Count dependencies per module
- **Cohesion**: Measure internal relatedness

## Language-Specific Notes

### Python

- Use Protocols for abstractions (PEP 544)
- Dataclasses for immutable data (`frozen=True`)
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Type hints enable safe refactoring

See the [Python](../python/SKILL.md) skill for detailed type hint patterns, testing, and code quality tools.

### General (Language Agnostic)

```typescript
// Before: Mutable state couples callers to internal changes
class ShoppingCart {
  items: Item[] = [];
  addItem(item: Item) { this.items.push(item); }
}

// After: Immutable updates — callers can reason locally
class ShoppingCart {
  constructor(readonly items: ReadonlyArray<Item> = []) {}
  addItem(item: Item): ShoppingCart {
    return new ShoppingCart([...this.items, item]);
  }
}
```

## Verification Checklist

Before committing refactoring:

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No behavior changes
- [ ] Coupling reduced or unchanged
- [ ] Cohesion improved
- [ ] No dead code remains
- [ ] Imports are clean
- [ ] Each module has clear purpose
- [ ] Can explain why each change improves design
