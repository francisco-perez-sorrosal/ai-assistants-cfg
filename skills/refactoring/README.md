# Refactoring Skill

Pragmatic refactoring practices emphasizing modularity, low coupling, high cohesion, and incremental improvement.

## When to Use

- Restructuring code or improving design
- Reducing coupling between modules
- Organizing codebases for better maintainability
- Extracting modules or introducing abstractions
- Eliminating code smells (god objects, feature envy, primitive obsession)
- Deciding whether to extract modules, add abstractions, or split packages

## Activation

The skill activates automatically when the agent detects refactoring tasks: restructuring code, improving design, reducing coupling, extracting modules, or discussing refactoring patterns and code organization.

Trigger explicitly by mentioning "refactoring skill" or referencing it by name.
