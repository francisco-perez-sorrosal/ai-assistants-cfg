# Claude Ecosystem

Structured knowledge of the Anthropic/Claude platform -- models, API features, SDKs, and documentation. Use as an ecosystem map to find what is available, choose between options, and locate authoritative sources.

**Satellite files** (loaded on-demand):

- [references/api-features.md](references/api-features.md) -- detailed API feature coverage, usage patterns, availability
- [references/sdk-patterns.md](references/sdk-patterns.md) -- SDK idioms, async patterns, error handling, Agent SDK
- [references/docs-map.md](references/docs-map.md) -- documentation site navigation, repo index, LLM-friendly URLs
- [references/platform-services.md](references/platform-services.md) -- batch processing, prompt caching, Files API, data residency

## Current Model Lineup

| Model | Model ID | Context | Max Output | Key Strengths |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Opus 4.6 | `claude-opus-4-6-20250610` | 200K | 32K | Highest capability. Complex reasoning, coding, extended thinking, adaptive thinking |
| Sonnet 4.5 | `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250514` | 200K | 16K | Balanced performance and cost. Hybrid extended thinking. Fast |
| Haiku 4.5 | `claude-haiku-4-5-20250514` | 200K | 8K | Fastest and cheapest. Classification, routing, high-volume tasks |

**Extended context (beta):** All models support up to 1M tokens with the `anthropic-beta: interleaved-thinking-2025-05-14` header or equivalent beta flag.

### Model Selection Heuristics

- **Default choice:** Sonnet 4.5 -- best balance of capability, speed, and cost for most tasks
- **Maximum quality:** Opus 4.6 -- when accuracy, nuance, or complex reasoning is critical
- **High volume / low latency:** Haiku 4.5 -- classification, routing, extraction, simple Q&A
- **Extended thinking needed:** Opus 4.6 (recommended) or Sonnet 4.5 -- set `thinking.budget_tokens`
- **Structured outputs:** All models support JSON mode and tool-schema-based structured outputs
- **Cost-sensitive batch workloads:** Any model via Batch API (50% cost reduction)

| PDF support | GA | Native PDF understanding in message content |
| Search results | GA | RAG-style citations from search tool results |
| 1M context window | Beta | Extended context beyond 200K default |

### Server-Side Tools

| Token counting | GA | Pre-flight token estimation endpoint |

### Files

| Feature | Status | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Files API | Beta | Upload and manage PDFs, images, and text files for reuse across requests |

See [references/api-features.md](references/api-features.md) for usage details, API shapes, and implementation guidance per feature.

## SDK Quick Reference

| SDK | Repo | Language | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Python SDK | [anthropic-sdk-python](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python) | Python 3.9+ | REST API client. Sync/async, typed models, streaming |
| TypeScript SDK | [anthropic-sdk-typescript](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-typescript) | TypeScript/Node | REST API client for TS/JS applications |
| Agent SDK (Python) | [claude-agent-sdk-python](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python) | Python 3.10+ | Agent framework. Powers Claude Code. Bundles CLI |
| Agent SDK (TS) | [claude-agent-sdk-typescript](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-typescript) | TypeScript | Agent framework for TS applications |
| Claude Code | npm `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` | Node.js | Agentic coding tool with hooks, plugins, skills, MCP |

**Additional SDKs:** Java, Go, Ruby, C#, PHP -- listed on the [Client SDKs docs page](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/client-sdks) but less widely promoted.

### SDK Selection Guidance

- **Building an API integration:** Python SDK or TypeScript SDK -- direct Messages API access with full control
- **Building an agent:** Agent SDK (Python or TS) -- higher-level abstractions for tool use, MCP, multi-turn
- **Extending Claude Code:** Claude Code plugin system -- hooks, skills, commands, MCP servers
- **Prototyping:** Python SDK with sync client -- fastest path to a working call

See [references/sdk-patterns.md](references/sdk-patterns.md) for initialization, streaming, error handling, and Agent SDK patterns.

## Ecosystem Relationships

This skill provides the **platform knowledge layer** -- what the Claude API offers, which SDK to use, which model fits a task, and where to find documentation. It does not cover how to build specific artifact types or use specific tools.

**Boundaries with related skills and agents:**

| Skill/Agent | Owns | claude-ecosystem Provides |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [agentic-sdks](../agentic-sdks/SKILL.md) | Building agents with OpenAI Agents SDK and Claude Agent SDK (implementation patterns, tools, multi-agent, hooks) | Model selection, SDK selection guidance, API features |
| [mcp-crafting](../mcp-crafting/SKILL.md) | Building MCP servers (transports, tools, resources, prompts) | MCP connector API feature, protocol context |
| claude-code-guide (subagent) | Claude Code operations (hooks, plugins, settings, CLI) | Messages API, SDK patterns underlying Claude Code |
| [python-development](../python-development/SKILL.md) | Python coding patterns, testing, tooling | Anthropic Python SDK specifics |

**Rule of thumb:** If the question is "How do I use feature X in the Claude API?" -- consult this skill. If it is "How do I build an agent with the Claude Agent SDK or OpenAI Agents SDK?" -- consult `agentic-sdks`. If it is "How do I build an MCP server?" -- consult `mcp-crafting`. If it is "How do I configure Claude Code hooks?" -- consult `claude-code-guide`.
