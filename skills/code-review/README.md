# Code Review Skill

Structured code review methodology with finding classification, language adaptation, and report templates.

## When to Use

- Reviewing code for convention compliance
- Post-implementation verification (via the verifier agent)
- Reviewing pull requests
- Ad-hoc code quality assessments
- Any context where structured findings with severity classification are needed

## Activation

The skill activates automatically when the agent detects code review tasks: reviewing code quality, checking conventions, assessing test coverage, or producing review reports.

Trigger explicitly by mentioning "code-review skill" or referencing it by name.

## Skill Contents
