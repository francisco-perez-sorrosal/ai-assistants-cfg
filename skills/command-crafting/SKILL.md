# Slash Commands

Guide for creating effective, reusable slash commands.

**Satellite files** (loaded on-demand):
- [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) -- command patterns, full examples, organization strategies
- [../skill-crafting/references/artifact-naming.md](../skill-crafting/references/artifact-naming.md) -- naming conventions for all artifact types

## What Are Slash Commands

**Slash commands** are user-invoked prompts stored as Markdown files that you trigger with `/` prefix during interactive sessions.

- User-initiated (explicitly type `/command`)
- Single `.md` file per command
- Support arguments (`$ARGUMENTS`, `$1`, `$2`) and dynamic substitution
- Can execute bash commands (`!`) and reference files (`@`)
- Project or personal scope

**Invocation**: `/<command-name> [arguments]`

## File Locations

**Project commands** (shared with team):
```
.claude/commands/<command-name>.md
```

**Personal commands** (across all projects):
```
~/.claude/commands/<command-name>.md
```

**Namespacing with subdirectories**:
```
.claude/commands/
├── git/
│   ├── commit.md      → /commit (shows "project:git")
│   └── merge.md       → /merge (shows "project:git")
└── docs/
    └── generate.md    → /generate (shows "project:docs")
```

## Naming Convention

- Default to **kebab-case**: `create-worktree.md`, `add-rules.md`
- **Abbreviations** acceptable for high-frequency commands: `co.md`, `cop.md`
- The filename (minus `.md`) becomes the slash command name: `create-worktree.md` → `/create-worktree`

## Command Structure

```markdown
---
description: Brief description shown in /help
argument-hint: [expected] [arguments]
allowed-tools: [Bash(git:*), Read, Grep]
model: haiku
---

Your command content here
```

## Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Purpose | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `description` | Brief description (shown in `/help`) | "Create a git commit" |
| `allowed-tools` | Limit tools Claude can use | `Bash(git:*), Read, Grep` |
| `argument-hint` | Show expected arguments | `[message]` or `[pr-number] [priority]` |
| `model` | Use specific model (short-form: `haiku`, `sonnet`, `opus`) | `haiku` |
| `disable-model-invocation` | Prevent auto-invocation | `true` |

## Argument Handling

### All Arguments (`$ARGUMENTS`)

Captures all arguments as a single string:

```markdown
---
argument-hint: [issue-details]
description: Fix issue with provided details
---

Fix issue: $ARGUMENTS

Follow our coding standards and write tests.
```

**Usage**: `/fix-issue 123 high-priority database`
**Result**: `$ARGUMENTS` = `"123 high-priority database"`

### Positional Arguments (`$1`, `$2`, etc.)

Access specific arguments by position:

```markdown
---
argument-hint: [pr-number] [priority] [assignee]
description: Review pull request
---

Review PR #$1 with priority $2 and assign to $3.

Focus on:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance issues
- Code style violations
```

**Usage**: `/review-pr 456 high alice`
**Result**: `$1="456"`, `$2="high"`, `$3="alice"`

## Advanced Features

### Bash Command Execution

Use `!` prefix to execute bash commands before the command runs:

```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Bash(git:*), Bash(find:*)
---

## Current Status

!`git status`

## Recent Changes

!`git log --oneline -5`

## Modified Files

!`git diff --name-only`

Review the above changes and create a commit message.
```

### File References

Use `@` prefix to include file contents:

```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Read
---

Review @src/components/Button.tsx for accessibility issues.

Compare:
- Old: @src/old-version.js
- New: @src/new-version.js

Provide a summary of changes.
```

## Slash Commands vs Skills

| Aspect | Slash Commands | Skills |
|--------|---|---|
| **Complexity** | Simple prompts | Complex workflows |
| **Files** | Single `.md` | Multiple files + scripts |
| **Discovery** | Manual (`/command`) | Automatic (context-based) |
| **Scope** | Project or personal | Project or personal |
| **Use case** | Frequently used prompts | Team workflows, expertise |

**Slash commands** -- quick templates, frequently-used instructions, simple operations, reminders.
**Skills** -- multi-file capabilities, complex workflows, team standardization, reference material.

## Best Practices

- **Clear descriptions**: Be specific -- "Review code for security vulnerabilities" not "Helps with code"
- **Always declare `allowed-tools`**: Without it, Claude prompts for permission every time
- **Use `argument-hint`**: Show users what arguments are expected
- **Provide context via `!` commands**: Include git status, project structure, recent changes
- **Test with various inputs**: no arguments, one argument, multiple, special characters
- **Don't duplicate rule content**: Commands define *process* (what to do); rules provide *knowledge* (conventions, constraints). If a relevant rule exists, Claude loads it automatically when the command runs — don't inline that knowledge in the command body

## Common Mistakes

- **Missing descriptions** -- commands without `description` are invisible in `/help`
- **No tool restrictions** -- without `allowed-tools`, Claude prompts every time
- **Name conflicts** -- project commands override personal ones with the same name; use subdirectories
- **Overloaded commands** -- slash commands work best for focused tasks; use Skills for complex workflows
- **Untested arguments** -- `$ARGUMENTS` might be empty; test and handle missing values gracefully
- **Inlining rule knowledge** -- if conventions or constraints already exist in a rule file, don't copy them into the command; rules load automatically by semantic relevance when the command executes

## Permission Management

Allow Claude to auto-invoke commands:

```bash
/permissions
# Allow: SlashCommand:/my-command:*
```

Prevent auto-invocation for specific commands:

```markdown
---
disable-model-invocation: true
---
```

## Debugging

```bash
# List all commands
ls -R .claude/commands/
ls -R ~/.claude/commands/

# View command content
cat .claude/commands/my-command.md
```

Within Claude Code, the `Read` and `Glob` tools can also inspect command files directly.

Verify: proper `---` delimiters, valid YAML, correct field names, expected argument substitution.

## Creation Workflow

1. **Define** -- identify the repeated prompt or workflow to automate
2. **Create** -- write the `.md` file with frontmatter and content
3. **Test** -- invoke with `/command` and verify behavior with various inputs
4. **Iterate** -- refine based on output; adjust tools, arguments, context
5. **Share** -- commit to `.claude/commands/` for team use
