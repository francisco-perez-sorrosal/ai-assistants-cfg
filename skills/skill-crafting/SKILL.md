## About Skills

Skills are modular, self-contained packages that extend agent capabilities with specialized workflows, tool integrations, domain expertise, and bundled resources. Each skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file with instructions and optional scripts, references, and assets. Skills activate on-demand when the agent determines they are relevant, keeping the base context lean.

## Core Principles

**The context window is a public good.** A skill shares the context window with system prompts, conversation history, other skills' metadata, and the user's request. Every token must earn its place.

**The agent is already smart.** Only include information the model does not possess. Challenge each piece: "Does the agent really need this?" If in doubt, leave it out.

**But not all agents are equally capable.** Skills may be consumed by agents with varying model capabilities. Avoid explaining universal knowledge (basic syntax, common idioms), but include enough context -- concrete examples, complete workflows, and explicit decision criteria -- so specific conventions can be followed correctly by less capable agents too. Examples and workflows are robust across the capability spectrum: they guide weaker agents without burdening stronger ones.

**Conciseness.** Aim to keep SKILL.md concise (500 lines is a good guideline, not a hard limit). Use progressive disclosure -- split detailed content into separate files loaded on-demand. Every instruction added dilutes the weight of every other instruction, in the skill and in others.

**Appropriate Degrees of Freedom.** Match specificity to the task's fragility:

- **High freedom** (text instructions): Multiple valid approaches, context-dependent decisions
- **Medium freedom** (pseudocode/parameterized scripts): Preferred pattern exists, some variation acceptable
- **Low freedom** (exact scripts, no parameters): Fragile operations where consistency is critical

Think of it as a path: an open field (many valid routes, give general direction) vs. a narrow bridge over a cliff (one safe way, provide exact guardrails).

## Anatomy of a Skill

```text
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md              # Required: instructions + metadata
├── scripts/              # Optional: executable utilities
├── references/           # Optional: detailed docs loaded on-demand
└── assets/               # Optional: templates, schemas, data files
```

### SKILL.md

Every SKILL.md consists of two parts:

- **Frontmatter** (YAML): Required metadata. The `description` field is the PRIMARY triggering mechanism -- it is what the agent reads to decide whether to activate the skill. Include ALL "when to use" information in the description, NOT in the body. The body is only loaded after triggering, so "When to Use This Skill" sections in the body are not helpful.
- **Body** (Markdown): Instructions loaded AFTER the skill triggers.

Write the body in imperative/infinitive form ("Extract text", "Run the script", not "Extracting text" or "You should extract text").

#### Frontmatter Fields

| Field           | Required | Constraints                                                              |
| --------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `name`          | Yes      | 1-64 chars. Lowercase alphanumeric + hyphens. Must match directory name. No consecutive hyphens, no leading/trailing hyphens. |
| `description`   | Yes      | 1-1024 chars. What it does + when to use it + trigger terms.             |
| `license`       | No       | License name or reference to bundled file.                               |
| `compatibility` | No       | Max 500 chars. Environment requirements.                                 |
| `metadata`      | No       | Arbitrary key-value pairs for additional info.                           |
| `allowed-tools` | No       | Pre-approved tools the skill may use. (Experimental)                     |

#### Directory Name Constraints

The directory name is the skill's identity (Claude Code infers the name from it):

- Lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only
- No consecutive hyphens (`--`), no leading/trailing hyphens
- If `name` field is present, it must match the directory name
- Prefer gerund form (`processing-pdfs`) or noun phrases (`pdf-processing`)
- Avoid vague names: `helper`, `utils`, `tools`

--> See [references/artifact-naming.md](references/artifact-naming.md) for naming conventions across all artifact types.

#### Description Best Practices

Write in third person -- the description is injected into the system prompt. Include what the skill does, specific trigger terms, and key use cases.

### Bundled Resources

- **`scripts/`** -- Executable code, run via Bash (not loaded into context)
- **`references/`** -- Documentation loaded on-demand (one level deep, TOC for 100+ lines)
- **`assets/`** -- Files used in output (templates, images, boilerplate), not loaded into context

Run `scripts/init_skill.py` to scaffold a new skill with detailed guidance and examples for each resource type.

### What to Not Include

A skill should only contain essential files. Do NOT create:

- INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md, QUICK_REFERENCE.md, CHANGELOG.md
- Setup/testing procedures, user-facing documentation
- Files about the process that went into creating the skill

**Note on README.md**: The Agent Skills standard does not include README.md in skills. In this plugin ecosystem, each skill has a README.md as a human-facing catalog entry (not loaded into the agent's context). This is a project convention, not part of the standard. README section order: When to Use, Activation, Skill Contents, Quick Start (optional), Testing (optional), Related Skills (optional).

### Storage Locations

- **Personal**: `~/.claude/skills/` (user-specific)
- **Project**: `.claude/skills/` (shared via git)
- **Plugin**: `~/.claude/plugins/cache/<marketplace>/<plugin>/<version>/skills/` (installed via plugin)

## Progressive Disclosure

Three tiers of context loading:

1. **Metadata** (~100 tokens): `name` + `description` loaded at startup for all skills
2. **Instructions** (<5000 tokens recommended): Full SKILL.md body loaded on activation
3. **Resources** (as needed): Referenced files loaded only when required

### Design Patterns

#### Pattern 1: High-level guide with references

```markdown
# PDF Processing

## Quick start
Extract text with pdfplumber: [code example]

## Advanced features
- **Form filling**: See [FORMS.md](FORMS.md) for complete guide
- **API reference**: See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for all methods
```

#### Pattern 2: Domain-specific organization

Organize by domain when a skill covers multiple areas. The agent only reads the relevant domain file:

```text
bigquery-skill/
├── SKILL.md (overview and navigation)
└── references/
    ├── finance.md, sales.md, product.md, marketing.md
```

#### Pattern 3: Conditional details

Show basic content, link to advanced:

```markdown
## Creating documents
Use docx-js. See [DOCX-JS.md](DOCX-JS.md).

## Editing documents
For simple edits, modify XML directly.
**For tracked changes**: See [REDLINING.md](REDLINING.md)
```

--> See [references/plugin-and-troubleshooting.md](references/plugin-and-troubleshooting.md) for plugin-specific progressive disclosure mechanics (base path injection, permission caveats, debugging).

## Skill Creation Process

Creating a skill involves these steps:

1. Understand the skill with concrete examples
2. Plan reusable contents
3. Create the skill directory and SKILL.md
4. Write the skill content
5. Validate
6. Iterate based on real usage

Follow these steps in order, skipping only with clear reason.

### Step 1: Understand the Skill with Concrete Examples

Skip only when usage patterns are already clearly understood.

Understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. Ask questions like:

- "What functionality should this skill support?"
- "Can you give examples of how it would be used?"
- "What would a user say that should trigger this skill?"

Avoid overwhelming -- start with the most important questions and follow up as needed. Conclude when there is a clear sense of the functionality to support.

### Step 2: Plan Reusable Contents

Analyze each example by:

1. Considering how to execute it from scratch
2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would help when executing repeatedly

Example analyses:

- Rotating PDFs requires rewriting the same code each time --> `scripts/rotate_pdf.py`
- Building webapps needs the same boilerplate --> `assets/hello-world/` template
- Querying BigQuery requires rediscovering schemas --> `references/schema.md`

### Step 3: Create the Skill

Run the initializer to scaffold the skill directory:

```bash
python scripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory>
```

This creates the directory with a SKILL.md template containing the required frontmatter (`name`, `description`) and a minimal body with TODO placeholders. Complete the TODOs and add resource directories (`scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/`) as needed.

### Step 4: Write the Skill Content

Start with the reusable resources identified in Step 2 (scripts, references, assets). Test added scripts by running them. Then update the SKILL.md body.

Consult these guides for content patterns:

- **Output format requirements**: See [references/output-patterns.md](references/output-patterns.md) for template and examples patterns
- **Multi-step processes**: See [references/workflows.md](references/workflows.md) for sequential and conditional patterns
- **Content type selection**: See [references/content-and-development.md](references/content-and-development.md) for choosing between scripts, worked examples, and prose instructions

### Step 5: Validate and Package

Package the skill into a distributable `.skill` file (validates automatically before packaging):

```bash
python scripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder> [output-directory]
```

To validate without packaging, run `scripts/validate.py` directly. Then check the deployment checklist at the end of this document.

### Step 6: Iterate

Use the skill on real tasks. Observe behavior -- where it struggles, succeeds, or makes unexpected choices.

**Author-tester workflow**: One instance (author) writes/refines the skill. Another instance (tester) uses it on real tasks in a fresh session. Grade outcomes, not paths -- agents may find valid approaches you did not anticipate.

**Observe navigation patterns**: Watch how the agent uses the skill. Unexpected file access order means structure is not intuitive. Missed references means links need to be more explicit. Overreliance on one file means content should be in SKILL.md.

--> See [references/content-and-development.md](references/content-and-development.md#evaluation-driven-development) for the full evaluation-driven development process.

## Cross-Agent Portability

The [Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io) is adopted by 25+ tools including Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code/Copilot, OpenAI Codex, Gemini CLI, Roo Code, Goose, Amp, and others.

**What's portable**: SKILL.md format, directory structure, progressive disclosure model.

**What's tool-specific**: `allowed-tools` names, MCP tool references, `compatibility` values, Claude Code extensions (`context: fork`, `disable-model-invocation`).

Keep SKILL.md body in standard markdown. Isolate tool-specific instructions behind clear headings.

--> See [references/cross-agent-portability.md](references/cross-agent-portability.md) for discovery paths per tool, portable vs. tool-specific breakdown, and skills vs. project instruction files.
