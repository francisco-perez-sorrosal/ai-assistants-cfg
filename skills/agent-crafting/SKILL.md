# Agent Creator

Guide for building agents -- specialized subprocesses with separate context windows, independent tool permissions, and focused system prompts. The term "subagent" is used interchangeably with "agent" throughout Claude Code documentation.

**Satellite files** (loaded on-demand):

- [references/configuration.md](references/configuration.md) -- detailed field docs, prompt writing guide, prompt template, CLI agents, troubleshooting
- [references/examples.md](references/examples.md) -- complete agent definitions showing distinct patterns (read-only, edit-capable, hooks, memory)
- [../skill-crafting/references/artifact-naming.md](../skill-crafting/references/artifact-naming.md) -- naming conventions for all artifact types

## Creating Agents

**Quick**: Run `/agents` for guided creation (recommended starting point).

**Manual**: Create a markdown file in `.claude/agents/` (project) or `~/.claude/agents/` (personal).

### Agent File Structure

```markdown
---
name: agent-name
description: When this agent should be invoked
tools: tool1, tool2, tool3  # Optional: omit to inherit all
disallowedTools: tool4      # Optional: denylist
model: sonnet               # Optional: sonnet/opus/haiku/inherit (default: inherit)
permissionMode: default     # Optional: default/acceptEdits/dontAsk/bypassPermissions/plan
color: blue                 # Optional: UI background color
skills: skill1, skill2      # Optional: inject skill content at startup
hooks:                       # Optional: lifecycle hooks scoped to this agent
memory: user                 # Optional: persistent memory (user/project/local)
---

Your agent's system prompt goes here.
Define role, expertise, instructions, constraints, and output format.
```

### Configuration Fields Summary

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Unique identifier, lowercase with hyphens |
| `description` | Yes | When Claude should delegate -- be specific, include "use proactively" for auto-invocation |
| `tools` | No | Allowlist of tools; omit to inherit all |
| `disallowedTools` | No | Denylist; removed from inherited/specified set |
| `model` | No | `inherit` (default), `sonnet`, `opus`, `haiku` |
| `permissionMode` | No | `default` for read-heavy agents, `acceptEdits` for agents that write files |
| `color` | No | UI background color for identification |
| `skills` | No | Skills injected into context (not inherited from parent) |
| `hooks` | No | `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `Stop` events |
| `memory` | No | `user` (personal prefs), `project` (project-specific), `local` (gitignored). Default to `user` for most agents |

## Agent Example

A concise debugger agent showing the key structural elements:

```markdown
---
name: debugger
description: Debugging specialist for errors and test failures. Use proactively when encountering any issues.
tools: Read, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob
---

You are an expert debugger specializing in root cause analysis.

When invoked:
1. Capture error message and stack trace
2. Identify reproduction steps
3. Isolate the failure location
4. Implement minimal fix
5. Verify solution works

For each issue, provide:
- Root cause explanation
- Evidence supporting the diagnosis
- Specific code fix
- Prevention recommendations

Focus on fixing the underlying issue, not the symptoms.
```

For more complete examples (read-only, edit-capable, hooks, memory), see [references/examples.md](references/examples.md).

### System Prompt Sizing

Keep agent prompts focused. When a prompt grows too long, use the `skills` field to offload domain knowledge:

- **Target**: 50–150 lines for the system prompt body
- **Hard ceiling**: ~300 lines — beyond this, extract domain content into skills (via the `skills` field) or inline it
- **Progressive disclosure**: Use the `skills` field to inject reusable knowledge that the agent needs but that doesn't define its core behavior

**Plugin agent self-containment:** Agents distributed via the plugin system must be self-contained. Reference/satellite files placed next to the agent definition (e.g., `agents/references/`) are NOT accessible when the agent runs in other projects — the sub-agent's `Read` calls resolve relative to the project's working directory, not the plugin cache. This fails silently: the read returns "file not found" but the agent continues without the missing content, producing degraded output with no visible error. If an agent's prompt exceeds the ceiling:
- Use the `skills` field to offload domain knowledge (skills are resolved from the plugin)
- Inline the content directly in the agent prompt (acceptable for agents since they run in their own context window and are not always-loaded)
- Do NOT use satellite/reference files that the agent reads at runtime

## Agent Location Hierarchy

Higher priority wins when names collide:

| Priority | Location | Scope |
|----------|----------|-------|
| 1 (Highest) | `--agents` CLI flag | Current session only |
| 2 | `.claude/agents/` | Current project |
| 3 | `~/.claude/agents/` | All projects |
| 4 (Lowest) | Plugin `agents/` | Where plugin is enabled |

**Best practice**: Use project-level agents (`.claude/agents/`) for team collaboration. For CLI-defined ephemeral agents, see [references/configuration.md](references/configuration.md).

## Constraints and Runtime Behavior

- **Agents cannot spawn agents.** Do not include `Task` in tools. Chain agents from the main conversation instead.
- **System prompt isolation.** Agents receive only their markdown body + basic env details, not the full Claude Code system prompt. They do **not** inherit:
  - Skills from the parent context (must be listed in the `skills` field)
  - Rules (`~/.claude/rules/` content is not injected into sub-agents)
  - Parent CLAUDE.md content (project or user-level)
  - Memory settings (must be set via the `memory` field)
  - Parent's conversation history or context
- **Session loading.** Agents load at session start. Manually added files need a restart or `/agents`.
- **Foreground**: Blocks main conversation; permission prompts pass through.
- **Background**: Runs concurrently; permissions pre-approved; press **Ctrl+B** to background a running agent.
- **Disabling agents**: `claude --disallowedTools "Task(my-agent)"` or add to `deny` array in settings.
- **Transcripts** persist at `~/.claude/projects/{project}/{sessionId}/subagents/agent-{agentId}.jsonl`.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Fix |
|-------------|-----|
| Overly broad agent ("General purpose helper for all tasks") | Focus on a single domain ("Security vulnerability scanner for authentication code") |
| Vague description ("Use when needed") | Specific triggers ("Use proactively after modifying authentication or authorization code") |
| No output format ("Just tell me what's wrong") | Structured output ("Organize findings by severity: Critical/High/Medium with code examples") |
| Kitchen sink agent (all tools, all tasks) | Specialized agent (read-only tools, focused on analysis) |
| Listing all tools individually when full access is fine | Omit `tools` field to inherit all |
| Reference files for plugin agents (file unreachable in other projects) | Use `skills` field or inline content |

## Integration with Other Features

### Agents + Skills

- Skills provide broad capabilities in the main context
- Agents delegate specific workflows to a separate context window
- Use the `skills` field to inject skill content into an agent
- Agents do **not** inherit skills from the parent -- list them explicitly

```yaml
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Reviews Python code for quality, design, and correctness
skills: python, refactoring
tools: Read, Glob, Grep
---
```

### Agents + Slash Commands

- Commands are user-invoked; agents are automatic or explicitly delegated
- Commands can reference or trigger agents
- Use commands for repeatable user actions, agents for delegated workflows

### Agents + Hooks

- Define hooks in agent frontmatter for scoped lifecycle control (`PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `Stop`)
- Configure project-level hooks via `SubagentStart`/`SubagentStop` events in `settings.json`

## Development Workflow

1. **Generate**: Run `/agents` to scaffold an initial agent definition
2. **Test**: Invoke with real scenarios, observe behavior and output quality
3. **Refine**: Adjust prompt, restrict tools, add examples and constraints
4. **Version control**: Commit agent files in `.claude/agents/`
5. **Iterate**: Gather team feedback, update prompts, add edge cases
