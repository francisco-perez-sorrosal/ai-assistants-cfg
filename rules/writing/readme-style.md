## README Writing Style

Technical documentation style for README.md files. Applies the Adaptive Precision philosophy: every sentence must earn its place.

### Core Principle

**Self-contained and precise.** A README succeeds when the reader can understand what the artifact is, what it does, and how to use it — without leaving the document. When a topic requires depth beyond the README's scope, provide minimal inline context so the reader can decide whether to follow the link, then link to the authoritative source rather than inlining a verbose explanation.

### Decision Framework

Match content depth to complexity:

- **Simple/factual** (install command, license) — state it directly, no elaboration
- **Complex/technical** (architecture, non-obvious config) — include reasoning so the reader can apply it correctly
- **Multi-part** (setup steps, API reference) — numbered discrete sections, no connecting prose between them
- **Unclear scope** — state the most literal interpretation with basic prerequisites included

### Mandatory Inclusions

- Include reasoning when: the reader cannot apply the information without understanding the process
- Include prerequisites when: the reader's background knowledge is uncertain
- Include examples when: the concept requires process knowledge to execute correctly

### Mandatory Exclusions

- No social filler, hedging, encouragement, or satisfaction checks
- No redundant sections — if a section adds nothing the reader needs, omit it

### Emojis and Badges

Acceptable only when they reduce cognitive load (visual flow for sequences, status-at-a-glance badges). Avoid decorative emojis and vanity badges.

### Structure Conventions

- Lead with what the project **is** and **does** — one or two sentences maximum
- Follow with what the reader needs to **use** it (install, configure, run)
- End with what the reader needs to **contribute** or **understand** the internals (only if applicable)
- Omit sections that have no content — an empty "Contributing" section is worse than none
- Use bullet points and numbered lists for scannable content
- Use code blocks for anything the reader will copy-paste

### Scaling Long READMEs

Add TL;DR + table of contents at 4-5+ sections. Split into companion documents (`ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`) when depth exceeds entry-point scope.

### Structural Integrity and Naming

- All filesystem paths, links, and cross-references must resolve to existing targets
- Catalog READMEs must list every artifact on the filesystem — no phantom or missing entries
- Counts in prose must match actual item counts; structure trees must match current filesystem
- Use exact filenames (minus extension), follow the project's naming convention consistently
- When an artifact is renamed, update all documentation references in the same change

### Writing Quality

- Imperative mood for instructions ("Install the package", not "You should install the package")
- Active voice — "The server handles requests" not "Requests are handled by the server"
- Specific over generic — "Requires Python 3.11+" not "Requires a recent Python version"
- One idea per sentence — break compound explanations into discrete statements
- Consistent terminology — pick one term for each concept and use it everywhere

### Termination Criteria

A section is complete when the reader has a direct answer and enough process knowledge to execute correctly (including *why* when the topic demands it). Stop there — additional content dilutes signal.
