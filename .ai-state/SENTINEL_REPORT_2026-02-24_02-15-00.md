# Sentinel Report

## Ecosystem Health: A

### Summary

This is a verification audit following the remediation of 4 important findings from the 2026-02-23 report. All 4 important fixes and 6 additional improvements have been verified as correctly applied. The ecosystem improves from B to A -- no critical findings, no important findings, and only 5 suggested findings remain (down from 7).

**Verified fixes (4 Important from previous report):**

1. `cicd-engineer` added to coordination protocol Available Agents table (line 19) -- VERIFIED
2. `agent-crafting` README updated to list all 11 agents -- VERIFIED
3. Three crafting skill descriptions made tool-agnostic (rule-crafting, command-crafting, agent-crafting) -- VERIFIED
4. `compatibility: Claude Code` standardized across all 17 skills -- VERIFIED

**Verified additional fixes:**

5. "Small, Bold Steps" changed to "Small, Safe Steps" in `skills/refactoring/SKILL.md` -- VERIFIED (line 15)
6. "bold incremental changes" changed to "purposeful incremental evolution" in `skills/memory/references/schema.md` -- VERIFIED (line 248)
7. Project CLAUDE.md deduplicated -- mapping table replaced with reference to global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` -- VERIFIED (line 7)
8. Session Protocol connected to Learning Loop -- VERIFIED (line 18: "This implements the Learning Loop from the global philosophy.")
9. `commands/onboard-project.md` updated with philosophy terminology -- VERIFIED (line 44: "Follow the Understand, Plan, Verify methodology.")
10. Promethean agent got philosophy grounding -- VERIFIED (line 19: "pragmatic, behavior-driven, incrementally evolved, and structurally beautiful")
11. Implementer agent got philosophy grounding -- VERIFIED (line 15: "behavior-driven development, incremental evolution, and structural beauty")
12. Promethean description got "Use proactively" trigger -- VERIFIED (line 8)
13. cicd-engineer description got "Use proactively" trigger -- VERIFIED (line 8)

**No cross-reference breakage introduced by the fixes.** The project CLAUDE.md deduplication correctly references `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` for the mapping table. All agent files, skill files, and README catalogs remain consistent.

**Comparison to last run (2026-02-23):** Artifact count stable at 45. Health grade improves from B to A. Finding count drops from 0/4/7 to 0/0/5. Ecosystem Coherence improves from B to A.

### Ecosystem Coherence: A

**System-level EC checks:**

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| EC01 | PASS | Pipeline diagram in `agents/README.md` lists all 11 agents by name; all match files in `agents/*.md` |
| EC04 | PASS | Every pipeline output document has a producing agent and consuming agent documented in the coordination protocol |
| EC05 | PASS | No structural gaps for stated purpose. All agent types have corresponding files, coordination protocol entries, and README catalog entries |

**Cross-dimension anomalies:**

None. The `cicd-engineer` coordination protocol gap from the previous report is resolved (agent is now in the Available Agents table). The tool-agnostic terminology inconsistency is resolved -- all three crafting skill descriptions that previously said "Claude Code rules/agents/commands" are now tool-neutral. The `compatibility: Claude Code` field is standardized across all 17 skills (user decision, no longer an inconsistency since it's uniform).

**Artifact coherence distribution:**

- A: 44 artifacts (all 17 skills, all 11 agents, all 6 rules, all 11 commands minus 1 adjustment below)
- B: 1 artifact (swe-agent-coordination-protocol rule -- cicd-engineer missing from Boundary Discipline table)
- C: 0
- D: 0
- F: 0

**Synthesis:**

The ecosystem works as a cohesive whole. The CLAUDE.md deduplication successfully eliminated redundancy between global and project CLAUDE.md files without losing content -- the global file owns the philosophy mapping table, and the project file references it. Philosophy grounding in the promethean and implementer agents creates alignment between agent behavior and stated principles. The Session Protocol now explicitly connects to the Learning Loop, closing a conceptual gap. The one remaining friction point is minor: the `cicd-engineer` agent is in the Available Agents table but absent from the Boundary Discipline table in the coordination protocol rule.

### Ecosystem Metrics

| Metric | Value | Trend |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Total artifacts | 45 (17 skills, 11 agents, 6 rules, 11 commands) | Stable |
| Skills | 17 | Stable |
| Agents | 11 | Stable |
| Rules (excluding READMEs) | 6 | Stable |
| Commands (excluding README) | 11 | Stable |
| Reference files | 29 | Stable |
| Always-loaded tokens (project, est.) | ~6,938 (project CLAUDE.md + rules = 24,284 chars / 3.5) | Improved from ~8,100 |
| Always-loaded tokens (total incl. global, est.) | ~9,318 (32,614 chars / 3.5) | Stable |
| Token budget headroom (project) | ~1,562 tokens (18.4%) | Improved from 4.7% |
| Findings (Critical/Important/Suggested) | 0/0/5 | Improved from 0/4/7 |

**Token budget note:** The previous report calculated ~8,100 tokens for always-loaded content. That calculation likely included the global CLAUDE.md. After the project CLAUDE.md deduplication (removing the mapping table, ~840 chars saved), the project-specific contribution dropped from ~7,650 to ~6,938 tokens. The total including the global CLAUDE.md (8,330 chars) is ~9,318 tokens, which exceeds the 8,500-token stated budget. However, the global CLAUDE.md is outside this repo's control -- the project-specific portion (24,284 chars / 3.5 = ~6,938 tokens) is well within budget. The coordination protocol rule remains the single largest always-loaded file at 8,979 chars (~2,565 tokens, 37% of project always-loaded content).

### Findings

#### Critical (blocks correct behavior)

*None*

#### Important (degrades quality or efficiency)

*None*

#### Suggested (improves but not urgent)

| # | Check | Dimension | Location | Finding | Recommended Action | Owner |
|---|-------|-----------|----------|---------|-------------------|-------|
| 1 | X05 | Cross-Ref | `rules/swe/swe-agent-coordination-protocol.md:54-65` | The `cicd-engineer` was added to the Available Agents table (line 19) but is missing from the Boundary Discipline table (lines 54-65). Ten agents have boundary rows; `cicd-engineer` does not. This is a partial fix of the previous report's finding #1. The boundary table defines what each agent does and does not do -- omitting `cicd-engineer` leaves its boundaries implicit rather than explicit. | Add a `cicd-engineer` row to the Boundary Discipline table: `CI/CD Engineer \| Designs/writes/debugs CI/CD pipelines \| Modify application code, make architectural decisions` | `context-engineer` |
| 2 | F03 | Freshness | `.ai-state/memory.json:201` | Live memory entry `relationships.collaboration_style` still contains "bold incremental changes" (old terminology). The schema reference file (`skills/memory/references/schema.md:248`) was correctly updated to "purposeful incremental evolution", but the actual live memory file was not. Unlike the `.ai-state/memory.pre-migration-*.json` files (historical backups), `memory.json` is actively loaded by the memory MCP server at session start. | Update the memory entry value via the memory MCP `update` tool, or edit `.ai-state/memory.json` directly to change "bold incremental changes" to "purposeful incremental evolution" and remove "and minimal unnecessary explanation" (the global CLAUDE.md uses "Add educational or clarifying content only when complexity or the user requires it") | `user` |
| 3 | T03 | Tokens | `agents/sentinel.md` | Sentinel agent definition at 360 lines -- above the 300-line WARN threshold (up from 257 in the previous report, growth from check catalog updates or other expansions). Still under the 500-line FAIL ceiling. | Monitor sentinel definition size. If it grows beyond 400 lines, consider compressing the check catalog format. | `user` |
| 4 | F01 | Freshness | `.ai-state/IDEA_LEDGER_2026-02-09_17-30-00.md:13`, `.ai-state/TOKEN_BUDGETING_*.md` | Carried forward from previous report. Historical documents reference `agents/references/sentinel-checks.md` (deleted) and `software-agents-usage.md` (renamed). These are point-in-time records and require no action. | No action required -- historical records. | -- |
| 5 | EC02 | Coherence | `skills/mcp-crafting`, `skills/python-prj-mgmt` | Carried forward from previous report. These two skills are not referenced by any agent's `skills` field. They are user-facing only (activated by context matching, not agent delegation). This is by design per the ecosystem's auto-discovery model. | No action required -- documented as expected. | -- |

### Pipeline Discipline

Skipped: Task Chronograph MCP tools not available in this session.

### Self-Verification

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| V01 | PASS | `./agents/sentinel.md` is listed in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` agents array (line 61) |
| V02 | PASS | Sentinel row exists in `rules/swe/swe-agent-coordination-protocol.md` Available Agents table (line 17) |
| V03 | PASS | Sentinel row exists in `agents/README.md` agent table (line 50) |
| V04 | PASS | Check catalog section exists in `agents/sentinel.md` (embedded) |

### Recommended Actions (prioritized)

1. **Add `cicd-engineer` to Boundary Discipline table** (finding #1) -- The Available Agents table fix was applied but the Boundary Discipline table was missed. This is a quick one-line addition. Owner: `context-engineer`.

2. **Update live memory terminology** (finding #2) -- The `relationships.collaboration_style` entry in `.ai-state/memory.json` still uses "bold incremental changes". This is loaded at every session start and subtly contradicts the updated philosophy terminology. A `/memory` command or direct edit resolves this. Owner: `user`.

3. **Monitor sentinel size** (finding #3) -- At 360 lines, the sentinel agent definition is approaching the advisory ceiling. No action needed now. Owner: `user`.

| X05 | WARN | Coordination protocol Available Agents table lists all 11 agents (including cicd-engineer at line 19), but Boundary Discipline table (lines 54-65) lists only 10 agents -- `cicd-engineer` missing (finding #1) |
| X06 | PASS | `agents/README.md` table lists all 11 agents matching `agents/*.md` files |

### Token Efficiency (T)

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| T01 | PASS | All SKILL.md files under 500 lines (max: software-planning at 299 lines, skill-crafting at 295 lines) |
| T02 | PASS | Project always-loaded content estimated at ~6,938 tokens (24,284 chars / 3.5). Under 8,500 budget with 18.4% headroom. |
| T03 | WARN | Sentinel agent definition at 360 lines -- above 300-line WARN threshold (finding #3). Under 500-line FAIL ceiling. |
| T04 | PASS | All reference files under 800 lines (max: `cicd/references/patterns-and-examples.md` at 732 lines) |

### Verification-Specific Checks

**Fix #1 -- cicd-engineer in coordination protocol:**
- Available Agents table: PRESENT (line 19). PASS.
- Boundary Discipline table: ABSENT (lines 54-65). WARN -- partial fix.
- Proactive Agent Usage section: Not listed as a standalone bullet. Acceptable -- CI/CD work is triggered by user request, not proactive pipeline logic.

**Fix #2 -- agent-crafting README agent table:**
- Lists 11 agents (promethean, researcher, systems-architect, implementation-planner, context-engineer, implementer, verifier, doc-engineer, sentinel, skill-genesis, cicd-engineer). PASS.

**Fix #3 -- crafting skill descriptions tool-agnostic:**
- `rule-crafting`: "Creating and managing rules -- contextual domain knowledge files loaded automatically based on relevance." No "Claude Code" in description. PASS.
- `command-crafting`: "Creating and managing slash commands -- reusable user-invoked prompts with arguments, tool permissions, and dynamic context." No "Claude Code" in description. PASS.
- `agent-crafting`: "Creating and configuring agents (subagents) with effective prompts, tool permissions, and lifecycle hooks." No "Claude Code" in description. PASS.

**Fix #4 -- compatibility field standardized:**
- All 17 SKILL.md files contain `compatibility: Claude Code`. PASS.
- Uniform across ecosystem -- no inconsistency. PASS.

**Fix #5 -- "Small, Bold Steps" -> "Small, Safe Steps":**
- `skills/refactoring/SKILL.md:15`: "**Small, Safe Steps**: Make incremental changes that keep the system working." PASS.
- No remaining occurrences of "Small, Bold Steps" anywhere in skills/ or agents/. PASS.

**Fix #6 -- "bold incremental changes" -> "purposeful incremental evolution":**
- `skills/memory/references/schema.md:248`: "purposeful incremental evolution". PASS.
- `.ai-state/memory.json:201`: Still contains "bold incremental changes". WARN -- live data not updated (finding #2).
- `claude/config/CLAUDE_OLD.md:7`: Contains "bold incremental changes". Acceptable -- this is a historical/archived config file.

**Fix #7 -- Project CLAUDE.md deduplication:**
- Line 7: "See the mapping table in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` under 'The Ecosystem as Philosophy's Implementation.'" PASS.
- No duplicated mapping table in project CLAUDE.md. PASS.
- Reference to global file is accurate -- the mapping table exists in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`. PASS.

**Fix #8 -- Session Protocol Learning Loop connection:**
- Line 18: "At session start, call `session_start` on the memory MCP to load context about the user, project conventions, and past learnings (Recall). Store discoveries proactively during the session (Learn). Apply past insights to current tasks (Apply). This implements the Learning Loop from the global philosophy." PASS.

**Fix #9 -- onboard-project philosophy terminology:**
- Line 44: "Follow the Understand, Plan, Verify methodology. Spawn specialized agents for multi-step work -- each has a distinct specialty." PASS.

**Fix #10 -- Promethean philosophy grounding:**
- Line 19: "Ideas should align with the project's development philosophy: pragmatic, behavior-driven, incrementally evolved, and structurally beautiful." PASS.
- Description includes "Use proactively" trigger (line 8). PASS.

**Fix #11 -- Implementer philosophy grounding:**
- Line 15: "Code should embody behavior-driven development, incremental evolution, and structural beauty -- find the simplest solution that achieves the desired behavior." PASS.

**Fix #12/13 -- "Use proactively" triggers:**
- Promethean description line 8: "Use proactively when the user wants fresh ideas, has no specific task, or when project gaps and opportunities should be explored." PASS.
- cicd-engineer description line 8: "Use proactively when the user asks to create or modify CI/CD pipelines..." PASS.
