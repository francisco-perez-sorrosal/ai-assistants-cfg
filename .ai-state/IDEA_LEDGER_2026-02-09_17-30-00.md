# Idea Ledger

Last updated: 2026-02-09T17:30:00Z
Sentinel baseline: 2026-02-08T14:30:00Z

Promethean-maintained record of ideation outcomes and project direction. Artifact inventory is not tracked here -- it is derivable from the filesystem and audited by the sentinel.

## Implemented

- **Ecosystem consistency audit** (2026-02-07) -- Audited all crafting skills against their governed artifacts. Fixed 2 critical YAML bugs, 5 stale catalogs, and 13 consistency improvements across specs and artifacts.
- **Verifier agent and code-review skill** (2026-02-07) -- Post-implementation review agent (`verifier`) and reusable `code-review` skill. Closes the pipeline's last-mile gap with structured verification against acceptance criteria, coding conventions, and test coverage. Three-layer design: coding-style rule (what) -> code-review skill (how) -> verifier agent (when + pipeline).
- **Implementer agent and skill ecosystem updates** (2026-02-07) -- Principal software engineer agent (`implementer`) with skill-augmented coding, self-review, and parallel execution support. Python skill renamed to `python-development` for naming consistency. Software-planning skill amended with parallel WIP.md mode. Planner upgraded with implementer collaboration and parallel coordination. Pipeline rule updated with Intra-Stage Parallelism.
- **Sentinel -- context ecosystem quality auditor** (2026-02-08) -- Read-only diagnostic agent (`sentinel`) auditing ecosystem health across seven quality dimensions. Two-pass methodology (automated filesystem checks + LLM judgment), produces `SENTINEL_REPORT.md` with per-artifact scorecards, tiered findings, and ecosystem health grades. Check catalog externalized to `agents/references/sentinel-checks.md`. Complementary to context-engineer (sentinel reads/reports, context-engineer fixes).
- **Sentinel coherence, persistent reports, and promethean integration** (2026-02-08) -- Added 8th audit dimension with two distinct levels: artifact coherence (per-artifact scorecard column) evaluates each artifact's alignment with goals/spec/related artifacts; ecosystem coherence (system-level composite) evaluates whether the ecosystem works as a connected whole. Sentinel writes `.ai-state/SENTINEL_REPORT.md` (overwritten each run) with `SENTINEL_LOG.md` for historical metrics. Promethean requires sentinel health baseline before ideation (new Phase 2) and records sentinel run timestamp in idea ledger. Timestamp formatting convention added to coding style. Renamed `PROJECT_INDEX.md` to timestamped `IDEA_LEDGER_*.md` -- removed inventory (filesystem-derivable), focused on promethean's purpose.

## Pending

- **Memory v2.0: Phased Intelligence Upgrade** (2026-02-09) -- Three-phase evolution of the persistent memory system from passive store to intelligent memory. Phase 1 (v1.1): access tracking, importance scoring, source provenance, entry status, session counter, dedup-on-write. Phase 2 (v1.1 procedures): enhanced reflect with lifecycle management, confidence evolution, ranked search. Phase 3 (v1.2): cross-reference links with relation types, connections subcommand, link maintenance. Based on research findings from 12 sources in LLM memory literature. Next: systems-architect.

## Discarded

- **Shell-scripting skill** (2026-02-07) -- Only `install.sh` uses shell; coding-style rule covers structural conventions. Premature. Reopen when a second shell-heavy file appears.

## Future Paths

Directional possibilities for where the project could go. Paths may be compatible or mutually exclusive -- this section maps the option space, not a single roadmap.

- **Multi-assistant expansion** -- Extend beyond Claude Code to Cursor, ChatGPT, and other assistants. Would require abstracting assistant-specific config into adapter layers while keeping shared assets (skills, commands, agents) portable.
- **Community plugin ecosystem** -- Evolve from personal config repo to a distributable plugin marketplace with versioning, dependency management, and discovery.
- **Project template generation** -- Use the accumulated skills and rules as a foundation for scaffolding new projects with pre-configured AI assistant setups.
- **Pipeline quality loop** -- Close the pipeline with a verification stage, enabling the full cycle from ideation through verified result. The verifier agent and sentinel with persistent reports are in place. The sentinel->promethean dependency creates a feedback loop: health findings inform ideation. Future iterations could add security review, performance analysis, and cross-feature retrospective capabilities.
- **Ecosystem observability** -- Extend Task Chronograph beyond pipeline activity tracking into quality monitoring. The sentinel's persistent report log (`SENTINEL_LOG.md`) and timestamped reports provide historical data. Could evolve into a full quality dashboard with trend analysis, degradation alerts, and per-artifact health sparklines.
- **Language skill expansion** -- Add language-specific development skills beyond Python, starting with TypeScript (Claude Code plugin/MCP server ecosystem) and eventually Rust. Each follows the `<language>-development` naming pattern established by the python rename.
- **Multi-project memory** -- Split memory into global (`~/.claude/memory.json`) and project-local (`.ai-state/memory.json`) tiers, mirroring Claude Code's own CLAUDE.md hierarchy. User/tool entries route to global; project/learnings stay local. Identified during memory v2.0 research but deferred as a separate architectural decision.
