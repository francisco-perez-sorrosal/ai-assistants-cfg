# Sentinel Report

**Run**: 2026-02-08T14:30:00Z
**Scope**: Full ecosystem sweep -- all artifacts, all 8 dimensions
**First run**: No prior `SENTINEL_LOG.md` exists; no trend data available

## Ecosystem Health: B

### Summary

The ecosystem is well-structured and internally consistent across its 31 core artifacts (10 skills, 8 agents, 5 rules, 7 commands, 1 plugin manifest). Agent definitions are high quality with strong boundary discipline, collaboration sections, and progress signal conventions. Skills follow progressive disclosure well. The main quality issues are: (1) stale references in `README.md` to phantom skills and incorrect command filenames, (2) always-loaded token budget significantly exceeds the 6,000-token guideline, and (3) two skills (`mcp-crafting`, `python-prj-mgmt`) are orphaned from any agent context. No critical findings -- all issues are Important or Suggested tier.

### Ecosystem Coherence: B

**System-level EC checks:**

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| EC01 | PASS | Pipeline diagram in `agents/README.md` includes all 8 agents with correct document outputs |
| EC04 | PASS | Every pipeline output document (`IDEA_PROPOSAL.md`, `RESEARCH_FINDINGS.md`, `SYSTEMS_PLAN.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, `WIP.md`, `LEARNINGS.md`, `VERIFICATION_REPORT.md`, `SENTINEL_REPORT.md`) has a producing agent and consuming agent documented |
| EC05 | WARN | `README.md` references `stock-clusters/` and `ticker/` skills that do not exist; `agent-intermediate-documents.md` rule missing from rules README catalog. These phantom references and catalog gaps create minor friction but do not block function |

**Cross-dimension anomalies:**

- `mcp-crafting` and `python-prj-mgmt` skills are not referenced by any agent -- they serve the user directly but are invisible to the agent delegation system. This is a minor coherence gap, not a functional issue.
- `README.md` is the most drift-prone artifact: 3 separate cross-reference issues (phantom skills, wrong command filenames, missing sentinel agent in agent table, missing `/manage-readme` command). The root cause is manual catalog maintenance without automated sync.

**Artifact coherence distribution:**

- 24 artifacts scored A (all skills except software-planning, 5 agents, all commands, 4 rules, plugin.json, CLAUDE.md, idea ledger)
- 5 artifacts scored B (implementer agent, software-planning skill, implementation-planner agent, README.md, rules README.md)
- 2 artifacts scored C (root README.md, `.claude/CLAUDE.md` -- due to cross-ref issues and token budget)

**Synthesis:**

The ecosystem functions as a connected whole. All agents reference correct counterparts in collaboration sections. Bidirectional references are consistent (e.g., context-engineer ↔ implementation-planner, sentinel ↔ promethean). The pipeline handoff chain is complete from sentinel through verifier. The main friction point is the root `README.md` which has drifted from filesystem reality -- it contains phantom skill entries and stale command filenames from before a naming convention change. The always-loaded token budget (CLAUDE.md + rules) significantly exceeds the documented guideline, which suggests either the guideline needs updating or the rules need trimming.

### Findings

#### Critical (blocks correct behavior)

*None*

#### Important (degrades quality or efficiency)

| # | Check | Dimension | Location | Finding | Recommended Action | Owner |
|---|-------|-----------|----------|---------|--------------------|-------|
| 1 | X07 | Cross-Ref | `README.md:21-22` | Phantom skill references: `stock-clusters/` and `ticker/` are listed in the Structure section and Skills summary but do not exist on the filesystem | Remove phantom entries from both Structure tree and Skills categories section | `context-engineer` |
| 2 | X07 | Cross-Ref | `README.md:27-28,129-131` | Command filenames use underscores (`create_worktree.md`, `merge_worktree.md`) but actual files use hyphens (`create-worktree.md`, `merge-worktree.md`). Commands table also uses underscore form | Update to match actual filenames with hyphens | `context-engineer` |
| 3 | X07 | Cross-Ref | `README.md:140-151` | Agent table lists 7 agents ("Seven agents") but 8 exist (missing `sentinel`). The sentinel was added after the README was last updated | Add sentinel to the agent table and update count to "Eight agents" | `context-engineer` |
| 4 | T02 | Tokens | `CLAUDE.md` + all rules | Always-loaded content totals ~39,352 chars (~11,243 tokens), nearly 2x the 6,000-token guideline. Breakdown: `CLAUDE.md` 2,821 + `.claude/CLAUDE.md` 2,697 + `coding-style.md` 6,060 + `software-agents-usage.md` 15,630 + `agent-intermediate-documents.md` 4,450 + `readme-style.md` 4,456 + `git-commit-hygiene.md` 1,752 + `git-commit-message-format.md` 1,486 | Either (a) revise the 6,000-token guideline to match reality, or (b) trim `software-agents-usage.md` (15,630 chars alone) by extracting detail into a skill. Note: `software-agents-usage.md` carries most of the weight | `user` |
| 5 | X07 | Cross-Ref | `rules/README.md` | The `agent-intermediate-documents.md` rule is not listed in the Current Rules tree or table. It exists at `rules/swe/agent-intermediate-documents.md` (4,450 chars) but is absent from the catalog | Add entry to the rules README tree and table | `context-engineer` |

#### Suggested (improves but not urgent)

| # | Check | Dimension | Location | Finding | Recommended Action | Owner |
|---|-------|-----------|----------|---------|--------------------|-------|
| 6 | F01 | Freshness | `agents/implementer.md:35` | References `skills/typescript-development/SKILL.md` which does not exist. The reference is in an illustrative list ("etc.") so it does not break function, but it is a dead reference | Either create the skill (per Future Paths) or change to "the corresponding language skill" without naming a non-existent one | `context-engineer` |
| 7 | T01 | Tokens | `skills/software-planning/SKILL.md` | 517 lines, exceeds the 500-line guideline (warn threshold 400). Contains both core planning methodology and Claude Code-specific usage | Consider extracting the Claude Code-specific section (lines 473-517) into a reference file | `context-engineer` |
| 8 | T03 | Tokens | `agents/implementation-planner.md` | 361 lines, exceeds the 300-line warn threshold. The most detailed agent prompt in the ecosystem. Contains full parallel batch supervision protocol | Consider whether parallel batch protocol could be extracted to the software-planning skill reference | `context-engineer` |
| 9 | EC02 | Coherence | `skills/mcp-crafting/`, `skills/python-prj-mgmt/` | These skills are not referenced by any agent's `skills` field. They serve users directly (activation via description triggers) but are invisible to the agent delegation system | No action needed if this is by design. Document as intentional if so, or consider adding `mcp-crafting` to context-engineer's skills for MCP-related pipeline work | `user` |
| 10 | X07 | Cross-Ref | `README.md:23-29` | Commands table missing `/manage-readme` command which exists at `commands/manage-readme.md` | Add `/manage-readme` to commands table | `context-engineer` |
| 11 | V01-V04 | Self-Verify | `agents/sentinel.md`, `plugin.json`, `software-agents-usage.md`, `agents/README.md` | All sentinel self-verification checks PASS: registered in plugin.json, listed in software-agents-usage.md agent table, listed in agents/README.md, check catalog exists at `agents/references/sentinel-checks.md` | No action needed | -- |

### Pipeline Discipline

Skipped: Task Chronograph MCP tools (`get_pipeline_status`, `get_agent_events`) are not available in the current session. Pipeline discipline checks (P01-P05) cannot be executed.

Note: `.ai-work/` contains leftover pipeline documents from the sentinel feature implementation (IDEA_PROPOSAL.md, RESEARCH_FINDINGS.md, SYSTEMS_PLAN.md, IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md, WIP.md, LEARNINGS.md). Per the agent-intermediate-documents rule, these should be cleaned up after the feature is complete.

### Recommended Actions (prioritized)

1. **Fix README.md cross-references** (findings #1, #2, #3, #10) -- The root README has 4 separate drift issues. A single pass by the context-engineer (or `/manage-readme`) would resolve all of them. Owner: `context-engineer`

2. **Update rules README catalog** (finding #5) -- Add `agent-intermediate-documents.md` to the Current Rules section. Owner: `context-engineer`

3. **Evaluate always-loaded token budget** (finding #4) -- At ~11,243 tokens, the always-loaded content is nearly 2x the 6,000-token guideline. The user should decide whether to revise the guideline or restructure `software-agents-usage.md` (which alone accounts for ~4,466 tokens). Owner: `user`

4. **Fix implementer phantom reference** (finding #6) -- Remove or generalize the `typescript-development` reference in `implementer.md`. Owner: `context-engineer`

5. **Consider size optimizations** (findings #7, #8) -- Extract Claude Code-specific content from `software-planning/SKILL.md` and parallel batch protocol from `implementation-planner.md`. Low priority. Owner: `context-engineer`

6. **Clean up `.ai-work/`** -- Leftover pipeline documents from the sentinel feature. Run `rm -rf .ai-work/` after merging any LEARNINGS.md content. Owner: `user`
